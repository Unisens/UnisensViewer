  title = {{{E}uropean data format 'plus' ({E}{D}{F}+), an {E}{D}{F} alike standard
	format for the exchange of physiological data}},
  journal = {Clin Neurophysiol},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {114},
  pages = {1755--1761},
  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {The European data format (EDF) is a widely accepted standard for exchange
	of electroencephalogram and polysomnogram data between different
	equipment and labs. But it hardly accommodates other investigations.
	EDF+ is a more flexible but still simple format which is compatible
	to EDF except that an EDF+ file may contain interrupted recordings.
	Also, EDF+ supports time-stamped annotations for the storage of events
	such as text annotations, stimuli, averaged signals, electrocardiogram
	parameters, apnoeas and so on. When compared to EDF, EDF+ can not
	only store annotations but also electromyography, evoked potentials,
	electroneurography, electrocardiography and many more types of investigations.
	Further improvements over EDF include the use of standard electrode
	names. EDF+ is so much like EDF that existing EDF viewers still display
	the signals in EDF+ files. Software development is limited mainly
	to implementing the annotations. EDF+ offers a format for a wide
	range of neurophysiological investigations which can become a standard
	within a few years.},

  month = {May},
  abstract = {A simple digital format supporting the technical aspects of exchange
	and storage of polygraphic signals has been specified. Implementation
	of the format is simple and independent of hard- or software environments.
	It allows for any local montages, transducers, prefiltering, sampling
	frequencies, etc. At present, 7 laboratories in various countries
	have used the format for exchanging sleep-wake recordings. These
	exchanges have made it possible to create a common database of sleep
	records, to compare the analysis algorithms local to the various
	laboratories to each other by applying these algorithms to identical
	signals, and to set up a computer-aided interlaboratory evaluation
	of manual and automatic analysis methods.},

  abstract = {Motion artifact is a major limitation in most practical implementations
	of wearable health monitoring devices. Especially in applications
	requiring continuous monitoring and high specificity, motion artifact
	can render a solution infeasible in real world use cases. We believe
	that the single most important technical challenge that will decide
	the success of wearable biomedical sensor systems is signal integrity.
	Principle possibilities to reduce artifact are explained, and some
	historical and modern examples are given, showing the relevance of
	this subject. However, still no proper models for artifact exist,
	nor is there a generalized approach to deal with this problem. This
	paper intends to call to attention the need for a common understanding
	in the community for a method of addressing this area objectively,
	and proposes next
	
	steps toward this goal.},
